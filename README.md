# Battlestar Galactica: The Synthetic Synthesis

A surprise birthday party organised for @SZS.  @SZS has always wanted to be a Cylon, so I wrote a Space Opera role-playing adventure featuring 7 ships & 24 characters tailored to her friends. We superimposed a space map over the neighbourhood and it played out marvelously. Feel free to adapt or take any of the story or ideas for your own surprise Birthdays. Only half of us were BSG fans, but everyone came away with a memorable event. 

## Background
It's been 40 years since the 12 colonies of mankind have heard from their progeny, the Cylons -- robotic creatures who rose up and declared war on their masters, then disappeared. In a sudden, devastating strike, the Cylons return and lay waste to the colonies. This story takes place in the days following the first Cylon strike on the human capital planet of Caprica. Cylons also no longer look like the metallic toasters they once were. They have evolved their appearances and managed to produce human-looking variants. Though there are only 12 such Cylon models, they were produced in endless numbers. As the devastation of the human home worlds is absolute, the few remaining ships that managed to get off planet are called to band together in a search of humanity's mythical 13th colony: planet Earth.

## Synopsis
As the complete colonial government is wiped out in the attacks, Sherin, then secretary of Arts & Culture, is forced to ascend to the presidency of the 12 colonies and fight for the survival of the human race. With a small crew, Sherin sets out to a pre-assigned military rendezvous point where she learns that the entire military fleet has been annihilated. To salvage what's left of the human race she reaches out to the remaining civilian ships in the sector.

Both Cylon and Human ships have jump-drive technology, meaning that they can travel vast distances in a moment's time. Coordinating jumps is a precarious affair, as a slight miscalculation could mean jumping right into a sun. Before making her first jump, Sherin and her crew scour the Cyrannus (see locations for details) looking for survivors. This is where the bulk of the story takes place, and where she interacts with the other characters in the plot.

5 out of 12 humanoid Cylon are in fact ancient Cylon who travelled from the mythical 13th colony and gave the tin-headed Cylons their human form. Between the 5 of them they share the complete Synth-netic make-up which will be a vital plot device in the finale. Through-out the story, information and disinformation is released about the identity of these 5 ancient Cylon, and it will slowly be revealed that Sherin is in fact is one of them.

Making sense of the information will be vital for shaping Sherin's ultimate decision where she seals the fate of all humankind. As the last ship Sherin discovers carries a Cylon technology called the 'Synthetic Synthesis', she no longer just needs to choose between humanity and Cylon but has a chance of uniting our species as one. This last ship is a Cylon science vessel carrying pacifist Cylon researchers. They have been working on the Synthetic Synthesis technology, which could theoretically allow the two species to be hybridised. As the leader of humanity, Sherin at this point is forced to take a stand on which species is most deserving of survival: the Humans, the Cylon, or in fact a synthesis of both species.

Each choice results in a different ending (see endings), with the synthesis choice having special conditions. In order for a synthesis of the two species to work, Sherin will need to separate out Cylon from Human, and explicitly reveal the identity of the 5 ancient Cylon. 

## Endings 

In the final part of the story, three people will speak out for the options Sherin has to choose from. Either of these options will go with her on the first jump towards starting a new civilisation on planet Earth. A successful jump will see the people on the jumping ship running back to the flat (a 50 meter sprint :) ), whereas the group left behind will reach out with their arms and shout 'nnooooooo don't leave uss'. Yes, that dramatic. Each failure is detailed below. Identity is revealed by one at a time revealing your identities prior to the jump, in each case, our identities will decide whether Sherin's decision is successful. 

1. **Humans Solution**
    * **Scenario**: Cylons have destroyed our home worlds and cannot be trusted on a journey to find planet Earth
    * **Condition**: Sherin must only select humans to go on this journey. If one Cylon enters the jump party - including herself! - the scenario is doomed!
    * **Success** : All the humans on board ... if there is either just one male or female the narrator will still fail the mission cause that's just too much inbreeding for one species to handle! 
    * **Failure** : The Cylon's kill-command is activated and no matter how friendly they once were, they annihilate the remaining humans. 
1. **Cylon Solution**
    * **Scenario**: When humans created the Cylon, they played for God and now they feel His wrath. 
    * **Condition**: Anyone can go, but if humans go, they go as Cylon slaves.
    * **Success** : All the Cylons on board ...some Cylon will narrate that the future forever is set in the repetitive predictability of the machine. Even though they may have defeated the humans, without a purpose to live for, Cylons will always be beings without a Soul. 
1. **Synthetic Synthesis**
    * **Scenario**: Following the discovery of the Cylon Science Vessel, this scenario requires a 'synthetic synthesis' meaning that our species are combined and that they will get the best of both, without the hate of either. Sherin will be tasked with dividing us up, though she'll be able to ask everyone a couple of questions before she decides who goes where. Then when the lines are drawn, and the synthetic synthesis machine starts the synthesis, One by one they will be revealing H or C cards they carry  and `Mart` will be narrating and keep track of the scores.... 
    * **Condition**:  
        1. Cylons and humans are separated out equally, so the synthesis process will know which features to select. There is a fault-tolerance of 6 misplaced people before the synthesis fails.
        2. Have _all_ five ancient Cylon in the Cylon group. These Cylon are the ancient models, and all are needed to provide the complete Synth-netic make-up of the Cylon species.
    * **Success** : All on board! All of us get to jump towards planet Earth! 
    * **Failure** : Everyone becomes a mutant abomination! If we turn into mutants, we could all try and eat .. I mean embrace Sherin as a symbolic suffocated ending.

#### Ancient Cylon

Since you are one of the Ancient Cylon, there is only one of you. Unlike the regular Cylon which have unlimited copies, so you cannot show up in parts which you were not scripted to appear. You play a vital part in the final act, so please be prepared to hint to Sherin throughout the narrative in subtle ways that you are indeed an ancient Cylon. This can be done by referencing that you have 'planets worth of experience' or 'wisdom beyond many civilisations', you have also brought the human form to the regular Cylons, so references to this are fair play. 

#### Regular Cylon

Since you are a regular Cylon, you can actually show up in other parts of the story, but you have to make sure that you either escape, or die in the process. Since we need you to be present for your scripted part.

## Character Descriptions

### Sherin // Ancient Cylon // The Galactic Spheres // President
    
If only you knew.

### Hayley // Cylon // The Galactic Spheres // Investigative Journalist

In the prelude you host the party and give a speech as described under the 'Briefing & Prelude' heading of the _Sequence of Events_ section. You join Sherin as part of the original crew of the Galactic Spheres. So when Sherin is ushered out of the room following the Nuclear Alert, you will join her together with 6 others.

At the 'twin pisces' rendezvous point, you'll inform the president that something is really fishy around there, and that you intend to find out what it is. This is where you are recast in the role of an investigative journalist. Your role is to keep the atmosphere alive in between contact with other space ships (and during if you want to add colour), by asking Sherin inconvenient questions and by volunteering inappropriate opinions about her leadership direction and anything to do with Human-Cylon relations and how the people on board this ship are treated. Just run with it! 

Ciosa will be trying to implicate you as a Cylon, you will always deny it. But give Sherin sufficient reason to doubt your humanity so she'll be able to put you in the right group for the Synthetic Synthesis Finale.

### Lisette // Cylon // The Galactic Spheres // President's Cylon Mind

You join Sherin immediately. So when Sherin is ushered out of the room following the Nuclear Alert, you will join her together with 6 others.

Act out Sherin's Cylon sub-conscious. You will be a figment of her imagination, so no-one else will respond or interact with you. Your role is to plant the seed of doubt in Sherin's mind about her loyalty to humanity, while extolling the virtues of being a Cylon. 

You can disappear off the ship at any time you want as you are imaginary. The physical version will be revealed to be on board the Cylon Cypher, where you are an operator in the telekinesis division. They will give you up, as you are a traitor to their cause. Everyone can see you now, but you can still just address Sherin to keep it creepy.

### Mart // Human // The Galactic Spheres // Presidential Aid

Make sure the story develops as intended.

### Ciosa // Human // The Galactic Spheres // Hotshot Viper Pilot

There's no Starbucks in this universe. But if there's any character that's close to Thrace, it is you. You are a constant pain in the ass with your nagging suspicions about there being Cylons amongst the crew of the Galactic Spheres. You can point fingers at crew members, but you'll never actually out any of them as Cylon. Be especially critical of Hayley, who is a Cylon. She is reporting on Human-Cylon relations, so you'll be able to find plenty of ways to dirty her along the way. Where some roles are more lenient towards the Cylon, your extreme paranoia means that every thing, every one is suspect every time.

You join Sherin as part of the original crew of the Galactic Spheres. So when Sherin is ushered out of the room following the Nuclear Alert, you will join her together with 6 others. You'll be with her for the whole journey. You'll also be responsible for placing people in the brig when Sherin wants them there.

In the finale you will be the one making the case for the humans only ending. Sherin will just have discovered the Synthetic Synthesis technology and will be very inclined to use it. Prepare some good arguments against it, cause I bet you'll need them!

### Janice // Human // The Galactic Spheres // Cylon Expert

You join Sherin as part of the original crew of the Galactic Spheres. So when Sherin is ushered out of the room following the Nuclear Alert, you will join her together with 6 others.

Your role is to provide Sherin with the sense that there is an imminent Cylon threat, though you'll remind her that if there are any specimen that we could capture Alive, you'd love to study them. Over the course of the story, several Cylon will end up in the brig. You can use your methods to get vital information out of them. During the briefing, we'll go over exactly who you should pursue for what. I'd also really appreciate it if you could fill in the non-BSG fanatics (while they are on board our ship) on the motivations and the characteristics of the Cylon, so they can enjoy the story too!

### Rayla // Human // The Galactic Spheres // CIC Officer

You join Sherin as part of the original crew of the Galactic Spheres. So when Sherin is ushered out of the room following the Nuclear Alert, you will join her together with 6 others. 

Your role is to provide Sherin with the sense that she is in control of the ship and has hundreds of people at her command. As the CIC Officer you'll use the language of the [CIC](http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/CIC) to give the experience its unique BSG feel. You'll also be the [DRADIS](http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/DRADIS) operator and will announce the appearance of a new vessel on dradis and will report its identity. During the briefing, we'll go over the procedures for this.

### Dan // Cylon // Palace Potemkin // Casino Boss

The flamboyant casino owner hasn't stayed on top by playing nice. He loves a game of _spacers_ and is known to bet the house on outrageous bets. Whether he wins or not, this man never loses. 

When the Galactic Spheres docks with your ship, you will feign ignorance of events and laugh them away. Wondering whether the self-styled president would like to try out her delusions at a game of _spacers_ you explain the game and set the stakes high. If Sherin or any of her crew-members win, the Potemkin joins the fleet. If you or your partner wins, the Casino will get the rights to the Galactic Spheres. If Sherin really wins, all is well. If your party wins, you can suggest that as long as you allow to be self-governed, the Potemkin will join them anyway, as you simply wouldn't mind some new faces with eager wallets walking through its bowels.

### Laine // Human // Palace Potemkin // Previously Owned Space Craft Trader

As one of the notorious traders who exchanges disappearances for ships, you will try to get Sherin to go all in on the bid. You'll be responsible for building out the shady trader side of the narrative to bring the Potemkin to life. Just keep mentioning in subtle ways how it's possible for you to give such stellar deals - and the casino benefits too!

You'll be asked to join in on a game of _spacers_. Dan designed this game and will explain it to you. If Sherin or any of her crew-members win, the Potemkin joins the fleet. If you or your partner wins, the you'll have found yourself your sweetest deal yet.

### Chris // Ancient Cylon // Cylon Raider // Infiltrator

Unaffiliated with any scripted ships, you appear on the Galactic Spheres half-way through the narrative out of nowhere. We will be cruising through the Fa Yuen Sector, and you will join our party by coming up from behind. As soon as you are part of the group, the Cylon Raider you arrived in is left behind and you will maintain that you were part of the original crew, being very understanding that the president has never noticed you before.

You will also be the delivery device for disinformation, and are free to question any deductions she makes that are favourable to Humans. Your mission is to convince at least 4 other Cylon that the war could be ended by detonating a nuclear device when the fleet is within close range of each other. Your actions may result in your incarceration, so be prepared to bargain for your freedom by arguing for eternal return: All Of This Has Happened Before And Will Happen Again. When in the brig, you can tell the CIC officer or Cylon Expert that you will reveal your identity as an ancient Cylon in exchange for your freedom. Whether Sherin decides to free you or not you will disclose how the Humans of Earth too built their Cylon, before a nuclear war wiped out the human civilisation and left but five of the Cylon intact. To prevent that from happening again, you wish for the scourge of organic life to be extinguished.

### Kent // Cylon // Bermuda Void // Prison Warden & Human Hunt CEO

You are the brutal and insidious mastermind behind the Bermuda Void. The prison ship officially is funded through the tax-contributions on the 12 colonies, but accepting to 'lose' people in your void has meant that you also had to accept lucrative bribes. As you consider investments towards the improvement of the living conditions aboard the prison to be an absolute waste, you've channelled your funds into building a Human Hunting resort on Phallanx, an uninhabited moon of Picon. Feel free to make up the rules involved in the Human Hunt, but as a Cylon you'd be sure to enact as much psychological as physical violence upon the hunted.

When Sherin docks with your ship you will give her a verbal guided tour around the premises. You'll mention hearing about the attacks on the Hum... Homeworlds and feel so very sorry that your prisoners are destined to participate in the Human Hunt. The stinking meatbags couldn't possibly deserve to be part of a the search for planet earth, and besides hasn't Sherin heard of the 'Myth of Australia', where criminals were sent to colonise a new world? We all know what became of that!

Be prepared to spar with Tom's arguments as a human activist. For example, argue that whomever responsible planet-side for putting these people behind bars, they were all  killed by the Cylon, does Sherin really think that'll tear them up? Half the prison population probably swears allegiance to the Cylon!

Sherin will ultimately decide whether you get to keep your humans (which means you and your crew return to the flat- oh no!) or the prisoners get to join the Galactic Sphere. In the former case, since you are a regular Cylon, you can actually show up in other parts of the story, but you have to make sure that you either escape, or die in the process if the prison ship hasn't been discovered yet by Sherin, cause obviously, we'll need you to play the Warden!

### Tom // Human // Bermuda Void // Human Rights Activist

After listening to Kent's insidious plans for the inmates, you protest in ways I could never script for you. But the more BSG-themed the arguments, the better. So for example, you can argue that with the destruction of the human home worlds, their justice system no longer applies in the far reaches of space. Or that since the human race was decimated, argue that we'll need all the men and women we can muster to keep the gene pool neat and diverse. 

Sherin will ultimately decide whether you Kent gets to keep his humans (which means you and your crew return to the flat- oh no!) or the prisoners get to join the Galactic Sphere and you join them on the quest throughout the story. The latter is a much better resolution, so I hope you manage to convince her!

### Erin // Human // Bermuda Void // Prisoner 37826

Victim of Cylon co-conspirators, you were sentenced to five years in jail, two of which are still on the clock. As a Defence Systems Security Clerk your job was to monitor all the video feeds in the building where the planetary Defence Mainframe is hosted. At the very same time on four different cameras in four different locations you saw the same person walking through the building and operating machines. This is possible because they were Cylon and it simply were 4 different Cylon of the same model breaking into the mainframe to disable the planetary defences.

You followed them on the security screens and noticed that they were collaborating with one of the facility's leading scientists. If his involvement with the 4 look-alikes wasn't suspicious enough, the scientist has had a tenure of 25 years without ageing one bit! You suspected all of them to be Cylon somehow, with the scientist being the leader of the bunch.

Of course before the Cylon attack, everyone thought you were crazy for suggesting that Cylon looked like Humans, after all only 37 years ago they looked like ill-adjusted robots. To silence you, the scientist made sure that you were found guilty of espionage, and sent to the Bermuda Void. You will promise to reveal the identity of this scientist, if Sherin takes you under her wing. The Cylon you are looking to expose is Chris. You'll find him having joined the Galactic Spheres under mysterious circumstances.

### Sissi // Cylon // Pilgrim's Blessing // Mono-theist

Your role is to provide Sherin with a sense that the same theological questions of the BattleStar Universe are being addressed in our version of the universe, and in your case suggest through your discourse that you are in fact one of the Cylon Models.

You will be arguing in favour of the Cylon religion, without making overt claims of being a Cylon. This religion is closer to Christianity whereas the religion of Human Colonies is more Classical  poly-theists.

For inspiration to talk about your religion, there's a neat [wiki page](http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Cylon_Religion) dedicated to the subject.

Following your argument with Peter, you will ask Sherin which side she thinks is most plausible. If she picks your side, you have gained her trust and wish to be her spiritual councillor, if she picks the other position you plea with her to take you with her because she is committing a grievous mistake.

Since you are a regular Cylon, you can actually show up in other parts of the story, but you have to make sure that you either escape, or die in the process. Since we need you to be present for your scripted part.

### Peter // Human // Pilgrim's Blessing // Poly-theist

Your role is to provide Sherin with a sense that the same theological questions of the BattleStar Universe are being addressed in our version of the universe.

You will be arguing in favour of the Human religion. This religion is closer to Roman religion whereas the religion of the Cylon is closer to Christianity. You have some of the best self-deprecating humour, so I'm sure you'll know what to say!

For inspiration to talk about your religion, there's a neat [wiki page](http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_Twelve_Colonies_(RDM)) dedicated to the subject.

Following your argument with Sissi, you will ask Sherin which side she thinks is most plausible. If she picks your side, you have gained her trust and wish to be her spiritual councillor, if she picks the other position you plea with her to take you with her because she is committing a grievous mistake.

### Leo // Cylon // Humanity's Hope // Professor of Ethics at Taubridge
Word has gotten around about regenerative baths in which Cylon consciousness is downloaded as soon as their physical form dies. As a professor of ethics your role it to argue for the immediate abolition of such baths as they deprive the Cylon of freedom through death.

### Rich // Human // Humanity's Hope // The Hyper Connected Mixed Media Professor  
Where is this Cylon homeworld? And how do we preserve its native culture? How do we interact with the Cylon without imposing our own values through toxic exposure? How can we ever visit their homeworld without inexorably changing the landscape of what once was the pristine Cylon homeworld in the days before Human tourism? These questions trouble you as the Hyper Connected Mixed Media Professor , and you'll be sure to remind the President that no interaction between our culture is without consequences.

### Janakan // Cylon // Humanity's Hope // Chair of Cybernomics at Caprica University
The visionary professor of Cybernomics you cant count your luck that the Cylon have returned! Now you can finally enact your plans for the 7th industrial revolution, by replacing all the human work force by Cylon, overriding their logic circuitry by providing them with less rewards the harder they work. This will make them incredibly obedient, and ultimately profitable.

### Lucy // Human // Rainbow Rising // Mother Gaya

Everyone on board will share a ultra progressive fact about life on-board the Rainbow Rising, but your role is to lead the president in a verbal tour around the ship and talk her through the ideas and practices you've developed while segregated from mainstream morality. You're naturally good at this, so I feel like scripting it would just do more harm than good! 

You'll ask your fellow commune members to share some of their experiences on board the ship, and you'll want to steer the conversation in the direction of your most valued member: 'The All Knowing God of Human Pleasure'. You'll create his persona by extolling all his virtues as the infinite lover. You'll ask Sherin is she wants share in your knowledge this man. Convince her, and we'll put him in the spot light.

### Wins // Human // Rainbow Rising // Estrella Vargis

Everyone on board will share a ultra progressive fact about life on-board the Rainbow Rising. When the president comes to visit your ship Lucy will ask you to share something about your life on the ship and you will tell her that you believe that love between a human and a machine is possible, you just plug into it on a spiritual level and its sensors will be able to read you. You can go into as much detail as you want :)

### Suhani // Human // Rainbow Rising // Sister Seven

Everyone on board will share a ultra progressive fact about life on-board the Rainbow Rising. When the president comes to visit your ship Lucy will ask you to share something about your life on the ship and you will tell her that you believe we are all inhabited by the same spirit, and that as the spirit moves from mind to mind we are momentarily left without awareness. That's why we can only think in 24 frames per second, because that's how long it takes for the spirit to touch all the human minds in the galaxy. This is also how telekinesis works, because sometimes the spirit will bring residual thoughts from the rest of humanity with it, and if it resonates with your attention, it will find your mind as a receptor.

### Paul // Ancient Cylon // Rainbow Rising // 'All Knowing God of Human Pleasure'

As the all-knowing God of Human pleasure, Sherin will try to find out whether you are a Cylon. You can talk about your belief that only Pure Love will foster a future for both Cylon and Human kinds. As Cylon cannot have offspring through natural means, you have been sent to bond with humans of a pure and all-embracing disposition, in the hope that the two kinds will spawn a hybrid species. Despite the copious of sex you've had to go through, your efforts haven't resulted in the desired offspring, and thus perhaps you can suggest that it is time for you to join the Galactic Spheres to pursue other forms of love.

Since you are one of the Ancient Cylon, there is only one of you. Unlike the regular Cylon which have unlimited copies, so you cannot show up in parts which you were not scripted to appear. You play a vital part in the final act, so it's quite OK if through the conversation with Sherin she discovers that you are one of the Ancient 5. You have also brought the human form to the regular Cylons, so references to this are fair play.

### Simon // Human // Rainbow Rising // Ernst Young

Everyone on board will share a ultra progressive fact about life onboard the Rainbow Rising. When the president comes to visit your ship Lucy will ask you to share something about your life on the ship and you will tell her about this particular drug you use which allows you to _feel_ what your genes know. The drugs reveals the ancestral memories encoded in your genes and project them into your conciousness! It's completely transcendental, you cannot truly know yourself without it. 

### Gabe // Ancient Cylon // Cylon Cypher // Master Syntheticist

You play a very important role in delivering the information that Sherin needs to inform her final decision, so please be precise when detailing the two conditions. Your apprentice will detail the Cylon Cypher's mission, but your role is to explain exactly what the scientific reasoning behind the synthetic synthesis is, and caution that it is still in prototype phase. 

When you talk about the second condition - all five ancient Cylon - you will reveal that you in fact are 1 out of 5. As punishment for your pacifist teachings however your visual recordings have been put on stasis in the memory bank, so you won't be able to directly ID who the other 4 ancient Cylon are. Of course feel free to drop hints as to their identity based on character traits. 

Since you are one of the Ancient Cylon, there is only one of you. Unlike the regular Cylon which have unlimited copies, so you cannot show up in parts which you were not scripted to appear. You play a vital part in the final act, so please be prepared to help Sherin along a little if she's completely at a loss trying to identify the other 4 ancient Cylon. See 'Endings' to read more about what role you play in the grand scheme of things.
    
### Julianne // Cylon // Cylon Cypher // Synthetic Specialist 

You will detail the story of your mission and how you decided that war was not the right path and that you have sheltered yourself from the wrath of the fellow Cylon by using cloaking technology.

You can say that while your master is unique (he is an ancient Cylon after all) there are many more like you, and that it was only through the unpopular teachings of the master that made realise the wrongs of the Cylon war machine and break the pact with your model range.

Since you are a regular Cylon, you can actually show up in other parts of the story, but you have to make sure that you either escape, or die in the process. Since we need you to be present for your scripted part.

## Space Ship Narratives

1. #### The Galactic Spheres 
    One of the fastest ships in the Human fleet. It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than _eleven_ parsecs. Its speed was instrumental in clearing the blast zone when the Cylon nuclear strike hit Caprica. The ships mission is to contact the remaining civilian jump-drive enabled ships, and plot a course for the mythical planet Earth. With the president of the 12 colonies on board, a make-shift executive office was set up from where the president governs. 

    A provisional brig has also been built into the storage facilities of the ship. One mustn't forget to uphold the law, especially in times of war. The Galactic Spheres used to be a luxury leisure cruise, making the cabins spacious and a-plenty! There is room for a small city - if only that many humans were left.

1. #### Palace Potemkin
    This illicit gambling den is the space-fairing equivalent of a floating Macau with the twist that all communications with the outside world are strictly forbidden, and expressly jammed. The hull is specifically designed to deflect all out-going and in-coming radio communication. It's a simple measure that ensures the house keeps its advantage. Get too lucky with the cards, get less lucky on your way to the hangar. I'm not saying that folks go missing here, just that there's always good deals on previously owned space craft. 

    Relying on couriers for news services, the casino bosses aren't yet aware that their clientele has been decimated by the Cylon attack, or even that Sherin has since assumed the presidency. When the Galactic Spheres dock with the Potemkin, the flamboyant casino boss laughs away Sherin's claims, but is willing to bet the course of the Palace Potemkin on a game of _Spacers_. If Sherin or her crew win, the Potemkin joins the fleet. But if the house wins, the Casino will have to find a bigger hangar for its previously owned space craft. 

1. #### Bermuda Void
    Cushy Caprican politicians like to think of the _Bermuda Void_ as detaining the 12 colonies' worst. Though the reason most prisoners are here is that to someone else, they were worth more by disappearing.  

    When the Galactic Spheres approaches the Bermuda Void, `Kent` is the fist person to welcome them as the prison Warden. Kent introduces the President to the practices in the prison and channels his inner Cylon when referring to them as _stinking meatbags_, _hot-blooded, bad-tempered_, etc.. `Kent` will argue that the lowest forms of humanity don't deserve being handed the key to paradise, the mythical 13th colony.

    Tom breaks up the discussion right after Kent is done explaining what his _Human Hunt_ company is for and cries foul as a Human Rights Activist. Tom first makes his case before Kent starts interrupting him with counter-arguments. Tom will plea for all these essentially political prisoners to be let onto the Galactic Spheres, and it will be up to Sherin to decide what to do with the inmates.

    While Kent & Tom argue, Erin represents the full prison population and keeps to the side-lines. Only when Sherin decides whose recommendation to go with does Erin reveal her character's reason for being there.

1. #### Rainbow Rising
    A safe-haven for those escaping the stifling morality of the Colonial order. For years, Rainbow Rising devotees have followed a strict curriculum of universal love, unconditional acceptance, and spiritual connectedness. In absence of constraints, there are hundreds of men and woman aboard this ship who have indulged in insanely exotic fetishes. All in all these social experiments aren't exactly vital to the survival of the human race, if it weren't for a very special member of the community. Two decades ago, a man joined the Rainbow Rising, and has been adored by all the members since. The man's ritualistic experience and resilience are fabled, earning him the title 'The All Knowing God of Human Pleasure'. He literally never tires, which in a community of free love sure comes in handy.

    Through hints of the Mother Gaya, Sherin will piece together that this untiring man is in fact one of the ancient Cylon. So whenever you talk about this man, be sure to mention his uncanny consistency of mood, strength, and behaviour. When you're around him you feel as if you're interacting with centuries worth of spiritual experience.

    Sherin will come ask you to join her on her journey to the Mythical planet Earth. Half of you claim to have been there, the other half already know the way. So you will all join Sherin's party.

1. #### Humanity's Hope

    An Elite conference facility which regularly brings together the brightest minds of the galaxy. Following the Cylon invasion, this weekend's 'Cylons Revisited' topic has become poignantly relevant. Completely oblivious to the real world consequences of the total annihilation of the human race, the intellectuals however continue to pontificate on hyper specific aspects that have come to light following the invasion.

    Despite your alarming lack of social tact and concern about the plight of the human race, Sherin will still insist that you join her as advisor on her journey to planet Earth. You'll all gracefully oblige.

1. #### Pilgrim's Blessing
    A religious retreat welcoming the various religions to foster interfaith dialog and understanding. Sherin will come to your ship while the crew is having a discussion over which faith is the one true faith.  

1. #### Cylon Raider
    Modified Cylon Raider with Zero-Neutron footprint allowing it to come close to the fleet while avoiding detection.

1. #### Cylon Cypher
    A stealthy science vessel with two of the greatest Cylon minds on board. An ancient master teaching his apprentice the value of Pacifism and the promise of science. Together, they developed a technological innovation which could define the course of both Human and Cylon civilisations. The 'Synthetic Synthesis' process promises a hybrid of species. The science vessel has operated out of sight of both human and Cylon eyes for the past two decades, but the attack on the colonies has forced them out of hiding. 

    Consequently, the technology that they were developing has yet to leave the prototyping stage and has a short-coming that it cannot tell Cylon from Human, but just takes a representative sample of a group's _genetics_ or _synth-netics_ before rewriting all the subject's core DNA. It is therefore vital that before commencing the synthetic synthesis, that humans and Cylon are expressly split into two groups. A second requirement for the process to be successful is for the Cylon group to contain all five ancient Cylon, cause only then will a complete picture of the Cylon synthnetic structure be transferred to the hybrid form.

    The Cylon Cypher is the last ship to be approached by the Galactic Spheres. After all other ships have been interacted with, your ship will hail the Galactic Spheres and ask for a meeting with the president. The Master will urge the president to think carefully about her options but insist that this is the correct path: The best of both species, without the hate of either.

    You will also carry a third Cylon on board. This Cylon is part of your telekinesis research unit, and is wholly unremarkable in your opinion. However, throughout the narrative this Cylon will have been appearing in Sherin's presence as a figment of her imagination planting seeds of doubt about her loyalty to humanity. She is a bad agent, and not in line with your vision of unity, so feel free to give her up if the dialog goes that way.

1. #### SpaceTruck Bravo
    Only ships with a jump drive will be able to join the `Galactic Sphere` in their journey to earth. The smaller and medium-sized ships like `SpaceTruck Bravo` will have to stay behind if there is no time to transfer their crews to other vessels. The crew of this particular vessel will call `Sherin` over the intercom and ask to be rescued. Unfortunately the second in command will realise that there is no time and the souls aboard the Bravo are lost. This ship is for anyone who only wants minimal engagement with the story.
